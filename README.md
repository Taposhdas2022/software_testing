# Software testing in Apache jmeter

In this project,we test some web Application  in Apache jmeter.

## Acknowledgements
We learn how to test software from our honorable faculty Md. Mohaiminul Islam Sir (Lecturer, UIU).
## Installation
Install JMeter: 
```PS for front end
If you haven't already, download and install Apache JMeter from the official website: https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi
```
Launch JMeter:
```PS for backend
On Windows: Double-click on the jmeter.bat file in the bin directory.
On macOS/Linux: Open a terminal, navigate to the bin directory, and run ./jmeter.sh.
```
Launch JMeter:
```PS for front end
On Windows: Double-click on the jmeter.bat file in the bin directory.
On macOS/Linux: Open a terminal, navigate to the bin directory, and run ./jmeter.sh.
```
Open or Create a Test Plan:
```PS for front end
To open an existing JMX file, go to "File" -> "Open" and select the JMX file you want to run.
To create a new test plan, go to "File" -> "New Test Plan," and then build your test plan using JMeter's GUI.
```
Configure Test Plan:
```PS for front end
Configure your test plan by adding thread groups, samplers (HTTP requests, JDBC requests, etc.), timers, assertions, and listeners as needed.
```
Set Test Plan Properties:
```PS for front end
You can set various properties for your test plan by right-clicking on the Test Plan element in the tree view and selecting "Add" -> "Config Element" or "Add" -> "Logic Controller" as needed.
```
Thread Group Configuration:
```PS for front end
If you're using a Thread Group, make sure to set the number of threads (users), ramp-up period, and loop count according to your test scenario.
```
Add Listeners:
```PS for front end
Listeners are used to view and analyze the test results. Add listeners like "View Results Tree," "Summary Report," or "Graph Results" by right-clicking on the Thread Group or the specific sampler and selecting "Add" -> "Listener."
```
Save Your Test Plan:
```PS for front end
Save your test plan if you've made any changes by going to "File" -> "Save" or "File" -> "Save Test Plan As."
```
Run the Test Plan:
```PS for front end
To run the test plan, click the "Run" menu at the top and choose one of the available options:
"Start" to run the test plan immediately.
"Start Non-GUI" to run the test plan in non-GUI (command-line) mode.
```
Monitor and Analyze Results:
```PS for front end
While the test is running, you can monitor its progress in the JMeter GUI. When the test is complete, you can review the results in the listeners you added earlier.
```
Save Test Results (optional):
```PS for front end
If you want to save the test results, use a listener like "Save Responses to a File" or "Simple Data Writer" to write the results to a file.
```
Stop the Test (if running in GUI mode):
```PS for front end
To stop the test while it's running in GUI mode, click the "Stop" button in the toolbar.
```
View Test Results:
```PS for front end
After the test run is complete, you can analyze the results using various listeners and reports to identify performance bottlenecks or issues.
